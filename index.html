  <h1>Humpback Whales Around Australia</h1>
  <h2>Where are the Whales?</h2>

  <!-- Seasonal Visualizations with Side Texts -->
  <div class="grid-section">
    <div class="side-text">
      <p><strong>Autumn and Spring:</strong> From April, Autumn until November humpback whales migrate up to 10,000km along the coastline of Australia. Once in warmer waters they reproduce. During spring, these whales can be seen returning south with the addition of calves. More humpback whales have been identified along the east coast. </p>
    </div>

      <div id="vis-summer" class="vis-container"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="side-text">
      <p><strong>Winter and Summer:</strong> Humpback whales typically migrate north for winter, spending the summers in Antarctic waters feeding on krill. From the atlas of living Australia dataset, more whales were observed around the Australian coast, likely due to the accessibility so their migration south to Antarctica cannot be fully seen here.</p>

      <h3> Humpback Whale migration along the Australian East Coast </h3>       
      <p> This flow map explores the journey's of 5 different whales over a series of months. Whales can be seen migrating along the east coast of Australia. Those tracked in the spring-summer months were heading south, whereas during autumn to winter heading north. Red dots indicate that the whale was specifically recorded in that location, while the black lines interpolate the whale's journey. This provides an example of 5 interesting journeys of the 48 whales recorded by the Australian Antarctic Program. Whales were initially tagged either in New South Wales, Queensland or East Antarctica. </p>

      <h3> Identified Behaviours: </h3>       
      <p> Whales were primarily observed while being active or migrating north and south. This is consistent with the flow map shown above documenting the tracked journeys of the whales. Whales that are milling refers to them staying in a relatively small boundary, without strong net directional movement. </p>

        <h3>Sea Surface Temperature Variations at Different Latitudes</h3>
        <p> Higher latitudes experience warmer waters throughout the year. For most latitudes Winter and Spring mean sea surface temperatures are similar, being lower than that of Summer and Autumn. For the purpose of considering temperature, latitudes from 45°S to 10°S were considered, and longitudes from 110° to 160°. </p>

        <h3>Sea Surface Temperature Trends across Seasons </h3>
        <p>All latitudes show less variation in sea surface temperatures per year during summer. This visualisation highlights the temperature of different waters throughout the year. Whale migration is in part due to water temperatures, so timings vary year to year as this fluctuates.</p>

      <h3> Ocean Acidity: </h3>       
      <p> Ocean acidity varies both spatially, and over time (see trends below). It is thought to, along with temperature have an effect on krill availability. As krill habitat is a primary source of food for humpback whales, this may affect their population and migration in the future. Specifically with regards to acidification of lower latitudes, as this is where whales primarily feed, so if this is altered and food availability changes it will have a significant impact. Ocean acidity has been visualised in a broader region surrounding Australia, from the equator to 90°S, and from 100° to 180° in longitude. The ocean is more acidic towards the equator, where waters are also warmer. </p>

        <h3>General Ocean Acidity Trends</h3>
        <p> The mean pH of the area analysed shows a steady decrease overtime, highlighting how in general ocean acidity is increasing. The most variability in acidification across the considered areas occurs summer each year. The mean here is considered for the entire area shown in the heat map. This takes a much broader average than the consideration of the southern measurement and shows more large scale trends.</p>

        <h3>Acidity of Southern Waters </h3>
        <p>Waters below 60°S show a much stronger annual cycle of acidity. It is overall more basic than the more Northern waters, but shows a similar decrease in pH (increase in acidity) from 2010. This reinforces the overall acidification of the area. </p>
